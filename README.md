This repository demonstrates a common error when using the Expo Camera API: attempting to access the camera preview before it's fully initialized.  The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version using async/await for proper asynchronous handling.  This ensures the preview is accessed only after the camera is ready.
